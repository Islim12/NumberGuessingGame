# NumberGuessingGame
🔢003-NumberGuessingGame: It is a number guessing game: every time when starting this app, there will be a random number without the user’s knowledge in the background (private) and 100 trials. In this project, it is aimed to control the inputs: If the user

1️⃣ Guesses the wrong number, the test number (trial) decreases. Also, if the user guesses a smaller or a bigger number, a text will appear depends on it.

2️⃣	Does not give any input and press “Tahmin Et” button, trial will not change and a warning text will appear.

3️⃣	Guesses the correct number, input will be disabled, a winning text appears with the score.

4️⃣	Does not guess the correct number and the test number (trial) is 0, input will be disabled and a “failed” message will appear.

🔮In addition, input keyboard will be resized by android:windowSoftInputMode="adjustResize" code line in AndroidManifest.
